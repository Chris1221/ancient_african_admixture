Fixes in this working version:

07/04/20:
    - Simulation plot now has all time points so that readers can easily see that the 40/50 cases are pretty much the same but starts to lose power after 60
    - IMF update to 30
        - Averages table updated
        - figure 1 updated
        - Heatmaps (SGDP & HGDP) updated along with captions
        - T test and linear model tables updated.
        - text updated (results section on eur donors)
    - Made a dendrogram of IMFs
        - on second thought, not including this as it doesn't really add much...


05/04/20:
    - Added to MSMC section with more explaination
    - Expanded HGDP main text slightly
    - Rewrote the HGDP supplemental section
    - New supplemental section on HGDP versus same subset of SGDP. (S1.3)
        - Two new tables (S3 and S4) which show a linear model predicting IMF based on papuan / african population showing statistically that a 2% difference in ancestry is apparent in the HGDP and the subset of the SGDP used to compare.
        - Discussion of these results
    - Removed largely redundant section at the end of S1.2. It wasn't saying anythign new.
    - Updated figure s9 with correct IMF and current, cleaner plotting style
    - Changed aspect ratio of migration plots to 9/16 to match Ne plots
    - Combined supplemental peak figures into one plot (SGDP and HGDP together) 
    - HGDP migration and Ne have been remade with new style and are now in one plot 
    - Subset plots are remade with new style and are now in one plot
    - Updated length plot caption and figure (swapped a/b, changed axis to reflext IMF, can't do points for some reason)


- Added figure S4 which plots the timing and magnitude of peak migration by population in the SGDP. This is in support of a sentence in the first section of the results.
- Updated all of the IMF results to reflect 40-70 instead of 0-100
    - Replaced SGDP figure
    - Replaced SGDP table
    - New HGDP figure (don't need a table)
    - Updated T Test results in text
    - Updated reference to numbers in text
    - Figure 1 has new IMF boxplot
    - Added a supp table for pairwise T test values to support significance claims in main text
    - Added a seperate analysis for CAHG vs niger-kordofanian
- Changed colors and labels on Fig 2

**Need to update in supp**
