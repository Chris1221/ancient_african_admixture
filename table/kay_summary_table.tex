Statistic & D & Z & Interpretation \\ 
  \hline
D(French-1, Yoruba-2, Yoruba-1, Chimp) & 0.030 & 4.355 & In the subset of variants in putatievly migrated segments, there is excessive allele sharing between the test Yoruban and Out of Africa groups (French and Han). \\ 
  D(Han-1, Yoruba-2, Yoruba-1, Chimp) & 0.056 & 8.037 &  \\ 
  D(Yoruba-2, Yoruba-1, Vindija, Chimp) & 0.000 & 0.012 & The test Yoruban is no closer to the Vindija Neanderthal than a comparable Yoruban. \\ 
  D(Mbuti-1, Yoruba-1, Vindija, Chimp) & -0.001 & -0.141 &  \\ 
  D(Mbuti-1, Yoruba-2, Vindija, Chimp) & -0.003 & -0.306 & Neither Yoruban shows increased Neanderthal ancestry over the Mbuti baseline. \\ 
  D(Vindija, Altai, Yoruba-1, Chimp) & 0.024 & 1.095 & Neither Yoruban shows more affinity to the Vindija Neanderthal than the Altai, as would be expected if introgression came from a Eurasian vehicle. \\ 
  D(Vindija, Altai, Yoruba-2, Chimp) & 0.034 & 1.526 &  \\ 
  D(Vindija, Altai, Mbuti-1, Chimp) & 0.002 & 0.103 &  \\

\caption{Summary of relevant D statistics. Putatively migrated segments were isolated in Yoruba-1 (the test Yoruban) and compared against variation in Yoruba-2 (comparable Yoruban). French, Yoruban, Han, and Mbuti individuals are from the Simons Genome Diversity Panel (sample ID {	t S_Sample-n.DG} in the Reich Human Origins Dataset), while Vindija and Altai are the published versions in the same dataset. Chimp ({	t Chimp.REF}) was used as an outgroup for all analyses.}
